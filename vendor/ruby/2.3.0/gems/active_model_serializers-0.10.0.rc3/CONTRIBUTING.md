## How can I help?

Everyone is encouraged to open issues that are affecting you: bugs, ideas, performance problems â€“ everything helps!

The first place to start is by looking at our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/issues).

The vast majority of development is happening under the `master` branch, currently slated for release as `0.10.x`. This is where we would suggest you start.

Fixing bugs is extraordinarily helpful and requires the least familiarity with AMS. Look for issues labeled [**Needs Bug Verification**](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/labels/Needs%20Bug%20Verification) and [**Bug**](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/labels/bug).

We are also actively working to identify tasks under the label [**Good for New Contributors**](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/labels/Good%20for%20New%20Contributors). Some bugs are expressly not good for new contributors, so don't expect 100% overlap between the two.

If you want to work on new feature development, look for the label [**Feature**](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/labels/Feature).

We are also encouraging comments to substantial changes (larger than bugfixes and simple features) under an "RFC" (Request for Comments) process before we start active development. Look for the [**RFC**](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/labels/RFC) label.

## Issue Labeling

AMS uses a subset of [StandardIssueLabels](https://github.com/wagenet/StandardIssueLabels) for Github Issues. You can [see our labels here](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/labels).

## Contributing

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Write tests for your feature, or regression tests highlighting a bug
4. Write the feature itself, or fix your bug
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
7. Create a new Pull Request

Remember to squash your commits and rebase off `master`.
